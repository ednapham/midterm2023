        <h2>Marcus Smart, "I love Boston"</h2>

        <p>
          The Celtics have a notable revalry with the L.A.Lakers.Both the
          nickname "Celtics" and their mascot "Lucky the Leprechaun" are. Marcus
          Smart's most famous quote is, "I love Boston. Boston loves me." So,
          why wouldn't he continue wearing the Green and White for as long as
          possible?
          <img

          Smart will be doing so following Saturday's announcement of his new
          contract extension with the Celtics.
        </p>

        <h2>All-Defensive First Team</h2>
        <p>
          The two-time All-Defensive First Team performer spent the first seven
          years of his career with the franchise, and now he's locked into a
          contract that would take him well over a decade with the team by the
          time it comes to an end.
        </p>

        <p>
          Smart is entering into the final year of his current contract, which
          was signed during the 2018 offseason, before his extension kicks in
          for the 2022-23 season. "There's nowhere else I'd rather play and no
          other fans I'd rather play in front of. I love Boston, and Boston
          loves me," said Smart. "We've had some great moments and success in my
          time here, but there's more to accomplish. I'm ready to put that
          Celtics jersey back on and get to work out on the Parquet with my
          teammates. "
        </p>

        <h2>Smart Lockdown Defense</h2>
        <p>
          Boston had good reason to seek an extension with Smart, and that
          reason extends far beyond his lockdown defense and his longstanding
          leadership within the organization. Yes, he is a game-changer at the
          defensive end who can defend any position at a high level. And yes,
          he's a leader in the community who cherishes the opportunity to play
          for this historic franchise. But he's a pretty darn good offensive
          player, too. To recognize this, one must look past the shooting
          numbers - although Smart has shot a respectable 34.8 percent from long
          range over the course of the last three seasons while maxing out at
          36.4 percent during the 2018-19 season.
